# C64-Programmes
These are a mix of C64 6510 asm code or BASIC

I'm hoping to store away some of my C64 programmes as I learn and experiment. At the start most of them will be me just write bits that test how to do things, then hopefully will migrate towards real games

I have an idea for a christmassy game where you play father christmas and have to deliver presents to houses down the chimneys, it may well have already been done by someone (when does anyone have an original idea anymore, if so it will be my interpretation of it.
